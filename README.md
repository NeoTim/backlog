In the spirit of transparency and open dialogue, we are making this backlog public. However, please don't interpret this as our roadmap (see disclaimer below). This is a living artifact that is expected to be in a constant state of evolution. It doesn't represent a promise or guarantee, and isn't 100% complete for strategic reasons.
